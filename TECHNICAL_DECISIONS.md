# Technical Decisions - Notification Platform

## Overview

The Notification Platform is a system designed to handle event delivery to clients through webhooks. The system is built following Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to ensure maintainable, testable, and scalable code.

## Architecture

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)

The project implements Hexagonal Architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters, which allows us to:

- Isolate the application domain from external technical details
- Facilitate testing by being able to mock external dependencies
- Keep the code decoupled and easy to maintain

The project structure reflects this architecture:

```
src/
  ├── application/          # Use cases (primary adapters)
  ├── core/                # Domain and ports
  └── infrastructure/      # Secondary adapters
```

### Application Layers

1. **Domain (Core)**
   - Domain models
   - Value objects
   - Domain exceptions
   - Ports (interfaces)

2. **Application**
   - Use cases
   - Business logic orchestration
   - Primary port implementations

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Concrete port implementations
   - External service adapters
   - Framework configuration

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. TypeScript

**Decision**: Use TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript.

**Reasons**:
- Static typing that helps prevent errors during development
- Better IDE support and autocompletion
- Interfaces and types that document the code
- Facilitates maintenance in large projects

### 2. Jest for Testing

**Decision**: Use Jest as the testing framework.

**Reasons**:
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- Native mock support
- Integrated coverage reports
- Intuitive and easy-to-use API

### 3. Immutable Value Objects

**Decision**: Implement value objects as immutable classes.

**Reasons**:
- Ensures data integrity
- Facilitates code reasoning
- Prevents unwanted side effects
- Improves testability

### 4. Error Handling

**Decision**: Use custom domain exceptions.

**Reasons**:
- Better control over business errors
- Clear separation between technical and domain errors
- Facilitates error handling in upper layers
- Improves error traceability

### 5. Dependency Injection

**Decision**: Implement manual dependency injection.

**Reasons**:
- Simplicity and transparency
- Facilitates testing
- Avoids DI framework complexity
- Better control over object lifecycle

## Design Patterns

### 1. Repository Pattern

Implemented to abstract data access:
- Separates business logic from persistence
- Facilitates storage implementation changes
- Improves testability

### 2. Factory Pattern

Used in value object creation:
- Encapsulates creation logic
- Ensures object validity
- Centralizes business creation rules

### 3. Use Case Pattern

Implemented for each business operation:
- Encapsulates business logic
- Maintains atomic operations
- Facilitates testing and maintenance

## Security Considerations

### 1. Input Validation

- Use of Zod for schema validation
- Validation at application boundaries
- Input data sanitization

### 2. Authentication and Authorization

- JWT for authentication
- Resource ownership verification
- Per-client permission validation

## Scalability and Performance

### 1. Asynchronous Processing

- Use of queues for notification processing
- Retry and fallback handling
- Batch processing when possible

### 2. Caching

- Client configuration caching
- Authentication token caching
- Cache invalidation strategies

## Monitoring and Observability

### 1. Logging

- Structured logging
- Appropriate log levels
- Context information in logs

### 2. Metrics

- Latency metrics
- Error rates
- Resource usage

## Next Steps and Planned Improvements

1. **Distributed Caching**
   - Implement Redis for caching
   - Improve response times

2. **Circuit Breaker**
   - Implement Circuit Breaker pattern for webhooks
   - Improve system resilience

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement per-client rate limits
   - Protect against abuse

4. **API Documentation**
   - Implement OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Improve endpoint documentation

## Conclusion

The technical decisions made in this project aim to balance:
- Code maintainability
- System scalability
- Testing ease
- Performance and efficiency

The use of hexagonal architecture and DDD allows us to maintain these qualities as the system grows and evolves.
